# PacMan
## Exercise on PacMan
In this project, I have created PacMen on the fly meaning there will be lots of PacMan moving around and bouncing off the walls all with different speeds. I have put two buttons on my webpage. When we click the “Add PacMan” button, a new PacMan will be create. When we click the “Start Game” button, PacMan will start moving around and bouncing off the walls.
